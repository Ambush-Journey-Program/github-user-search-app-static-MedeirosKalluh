## The Challenge

### Briefing

- Your challenge is to build this Github user search app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use the assets from Frontend Mentor, but please ignore everything else from there, you should consider this README as your brief/goal instead.

- For now, let's focus just in building the UI with static data. You can use the same text from the example or fill with your own information, as long as it is static and hardcoded.

- While you’re doing that we’ll create new `branches` for each new piece of your website, then send it to GitHub when the code is done, and open **Code Review.** The goal is to get used to the development cycle.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Github user card with all the information static (no API request and JavaScript work needed).
- [ ] UI should match Figma file.
- [ ] User should be able to type in the search input and click in the search button, but nothing should happen after that (no feedback needed for the search action).
- [ ] Dark theme only for now.
